# Day of the Week of a Specific Date

## Overview
This project aims to give the user the specific day of the week by the user input of a date on the format [ddmmyyyy]. 
This project is also used to practice the common Git commands, so I can learn how to commit changes, push the project
to the GitHub repository and others. Another practice with this project is to update it, considering when I wrote the first
version of the code, I didn't know concepts of methods and OOP in Java, making the code quite simple and amateur.

## Installation
Any compiler or IDEA to run the application.DayOfTheWeekTest is fine. 
Download the DayOfTheWeekFinder or the Java class inside it to use on your compiler/IDE of choice.

---

## Usage
Run the application DayOfTheWeek. Next, type in a date on the format [ddmmyyyy].

- You will receive the day of the week after.
- If the input is not on the specified format or the user types in exactly 8 letters, an error message will appear.
- The program will continue until the user enters a date on the specified format.

## Known Issues

- Code is only valid for dates starting in the year 1900!
- No JUnit test classes were created for this project yet.
